## Design  
Media2Archive was designed to be clean, clear and easily understood by all audiences using the application, header and footer sections persist throughout the web application to ensure navigation is kept consistent to provide easy navigation and a pleasant user experience (UX).  
The application uses mainly solid colours which contrast each other, for example a darker grey against a orange giving the feeling of hard edges to reflect DVD, Blue Ray boxes and the boxy appearance of a media collection.  
As a person with a visual impairment, the website has been designed with screen magnification and screen readers in mind.
