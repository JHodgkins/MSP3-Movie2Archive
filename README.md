## Design  
Movie2Archive was designed to be clean, clear and easily understood by all audiences using the application, header and footer sections persist throughout the web application to ensure navigation is kept consistent to provide easy navigation and a pleasant user experience (UX).  
The application uses mainly solid colours which contrast each other, for example a darker grey against a orange giving the feeling of hard edges to reflect DVD, Blue Ray boxes and the boxy appearance of a media collection.  
As a person with a visual impairment, the website has been designed with screen magnification and screen readers in mind.  

### Structure of pages  
The website application uses a mobile first approach with the page having a maximum width of 1140px which centre aligns at higher resolutions these constraints were used to maintain the userâ€™s focus, attention and aid sight lines.  

#### Header section  
The application follows a universal approach which comprises of a left aligned logo for Mobile through to Desktop.  
To the right is the applications main navigation, which is responsive, and full text links remain right aligned until tablet size and below where it will collapse to a right aligned Hamburger menu (toggle button).  
On devices tablet and below the user will be able to expand/collapse this menu using the menu toggle button to access all available menu items dependant on logged in status.  

#### Main content area  

#### Footer section  
The footer section was designed to be useful and useable; the footer is divided into two half page sections at tablet and above screen sizes.  
The left side will shows Movie2Archive social media links and the right side displays a copyright notice when on the landing page and when within the application.

### Colour palette  
![colour palette](docs/colours/accessible_colour_scheme.png)   

- Davys Grey: #565555 was used as to represents the darkness of a theatre.  
- Yellow Orange: #FFB341and Red Crayola: #ED254E were used to represent the certification colours for PG and 18.  
- Silver Sand: #C4CAD0 was used to represent steel book covers of DVDs and Blue Rays and leans on a sci-fi feel.  
- Magnolia: #FCF7FF was used to represent the home, a widely used colour in many homes.  
- White: #FFFFFF and Black: 000000 were used for text and background colours as they are contrasting colours easily readable and have a feeling of sharp edges.  
- Black and white were primarily used for text, as they carry a high contrast level and are easily readable colours.  
I used a tool called Contrast Grid (colour palette) to determine the foreground and background combinations to ensure a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 was maintained.  

I used a tool called Contrast Grid [view live colour palette](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23ffffff%0D%0A%23000000%0D%0A%23565555%0D%0A%23FFB341%0D%0A%23FCF7FF%0D%0A%23C4CAD0%0D%0A%23ED254E&es-color-form__tile-size=regular&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa) to determine the foreground and background combinations to ensure a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 was maintained.  
![Accessible colour palette](docs/colours/accessible_colour_scheme_wcag_grid.png) 

### Typography
Fonts used across the application were provided by Google fonts and were used in certain areas as to maintain readability.  
The two font families used were, Big Shoulders Display and Poppins, the fonts have a default fall-back of Sans-Serif.  
Heading elements of the application use: Big Shoulders Display, which gives a movie poster style to match the applications theme with Poppins being used across the remainder of the application elements, to ensure readability for users, the base font size was also set to 18px from the browser default 16px to aid magnification and all audience users.
