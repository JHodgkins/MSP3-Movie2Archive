# Research  

I have used recent personal circumstances and experience which relates to losing family members recently and as a family have the task to sort and consolidate personal media collections into a reasonable understandable state, when researching into the current availability and various offered applications available which cover archiving and monitoring media collections.  
I have also taken into consideration the ease of use as a factor as the application requires it to be usable, understandable and accessible to all ages.  

I found that there were available apps that shared many features including:  
- Selection of catalogue-based apps with varying features which expanded upon just cataloguing a collection.  
- Integration into online resources to show data relating to media entered.  
- Options to exprt media collection to alternative formats.  

I did notice a pattern when comparing paid apps to freeware apps which were:  
- Free apps may offer a limited capacity or restrict online lookup until a token or upgrade is made.  
- Paid apps offer capacity but also combine features beyond cataloguing which to some users may be unnecessary.  
- Large scale cataloguing apps seemed to focus on the deskyop environment or would bridge the gap by using an app to pass data to the desktop application.  

I have also found that there are some larger developers have separated their apps out into individual applications focused on specific areas such as DVD, CD, Books and offered them as bundles to reduce per app price, which is useful to some who require this but unnecessary for all audiences.  

The price to entry can also be steep with some applications costing just under Â£20.
The apps warrant their cost in features but also bring a host of features which in some applications introduces complexity to the user interface which may cause confusion to some audiences.
