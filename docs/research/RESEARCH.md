# Research  

I have used recent personal circumstances and experience which relates to losing family members recently and as a family have the task to sort and consolidate personal media collections into a reasonable understandable state, when researching into the current availability and various offered applications available which cover archiving and monitoring media collections.  
I have also taken into consideration the ease of use as a factor as the application requires it to be usable, understandable and accessible to all ages.  

I found that there were available apps that shared many features including:  
- Selection of catalogue-based apps with varying features which expanded upon just cataloguing a collection.  
- Integration into online resources to show data relating to media entered.  
- Options to exprt media collection to alternative formats.  

I did notice a pattern when comparing paid apps to freeware apps which were:  
- Free apps may offer a limited capacity or restrict online lookup until a token or upgrade is made.  
- Paid apps offer capacity but also combine features beyond cataloguing which to some users may be unnecessary.  
- Large scale cataloguing apps seemed to focus on the deskyop environment or would bridge the gap by using an app to pass data to the desktop application.  

I have also found that there are some larger developers have separated their apps out into individual applications focused on specific areas such as DVD, CD, Books and offered them as bundles to reduce per app price, which is useful to some who require this but unnecessary for all audiences.  

The price to entry can also be steep with some applications costing just under £20.
The apps warrant their cost in features but also bring a host of features which in some applications introduces complexity to the user interface which may cause confusion to some audiences.  

## User research  
I asked my family and friends, my family because we have all lost multiple people recently and friends who have media collections larger than normal size and asked them about the above findings and what would be important to them if needing to catalogue or archive something.  
Responses have been condensed for consistency  

### Initial questions asked  

**Question.** Have you had to catalogue media or something else before?  
**User.** _‘Yes, many years ago I was left loads if books and had to go through one by one just to know what was there.’_  
**User.** _‘Mo but we do have a large amount of books and media which to be honest we are not too sure what exactly is there.’_  

**Question.** Do you buy applications to solve a problem/task that needs doing?  
**User.** _‘No, I would rather do it myself, some applications just confuse me, buttons and links everywhere and I only have a smartphone.’_  
**User.** _‘Yes, but stay away from the more epensive ones as I never rarely need all the features that it offers.’_  

**Question.** If you knew what exactly is in your collection or a collection you have acquired, would you consider upcycling to others around you?  
**User.** _‘Sounds a good idea, I get back some space in my house and someone else gets some new media.'_  
**User.** _‘Really good idea, we have been giving to charity shops but some do not accept certain media anymore.’_  

**Question.** Would a record of the media you own or have acquired help with things like insurance?  
**User.** _‘I think it would, they are material things but would not want to lose them, so knowing what exactly is there means I could ask my insurer about these things.’_  
**User.** _‘Not sure about insurance but would help me find those films I tell my kids about but seems such an effory to dig around in the boxes just for one film.’_
